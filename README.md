# IP Messaging Quickstart for Java

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your
own video chatting apps with Twilio Video. Before we begin, we need to collect
all the credentials we need to run the application:

Credential | Description
---------- | -----------
Twilio Account SID | Your main Twilio account identifier - [find it on your dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/video).
Twilio Video Configuration SID | Adds video capability to the access token - [generate one here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/video/profiles)
API Key | Used to authenticate - [generate one here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/messaging/dev-tools/api-keys).
API Secret | Used to authenticate - [just like the above, you'll get one here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/messaging/dev-tools/api-keys).

## A Note on API Keys

When you generate an API key pair at the URLs above, your API Secret will only
be shown once - make sure to save this in a secure location, 
or possibly your `~/.bash_profile`.

## Setting Up The Java Application

This application uses the lightweight [Spark Framework](www.sparkjava.com), and
requires Java 8 and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). 

Begin by creating a configuration file for your application:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with the four configuration parameters we gathered from above. Export
the configuration in this file as system environment variables like so on Unix
based systems:

```bash
source .env
```

Next, we need to install our depenedencies from Maven:

```bash
mvn install
```

And compile our application code:

```bash
mvn package
```

Now we should be all set! Run the application using the `java -jar` command.

```bash
java -jar target/video-quickstart-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567). 
Open this page in a couple browsers or tabs, and start video chatting!

Everything you need to know about the coresystem setup for this server is explained [here](https://confluence.coresystems.ch/display/cloud/ODG+Smartglasses+%28ReticleOS%29+and+RemoteExpert).
